# video_surveillance_system

This project attempts to present vsStor, a PB-scale, network-based video surveillance storage system which is used for storing thousands of streams. Another major characteristic of vsStor is the scale-out architecture design which allows the performance to grow by adding more hardware.  
In this it makes use of clustered architecture for connecting various machines and rely on the webservice mechanism for communication between them
